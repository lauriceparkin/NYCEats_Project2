Know Before you Nom, NYC


In the window of every restaurant in New York City is a sign showing a grade of A, B, or C. As a New Yorker, I have always wondered exactly how the grades were determined and wanted to build something to better illustrate the grades and what was behind them. 

Using an API from the cityâ€™s Dept. of Health, I made an app that allows the user to choose a borough and then input a zip code and a grade. After submitting these two pieces of information, the screen will populate with 40 restaurants matching that criteria. 

This was built using React. 

To Do List - V2.0: Add an alert message if an incorrect zip code is typed. Add in links providing access to more restaurant data including violations cited. Explore the use of Mapbox to graphically illustrate the neighborhoods and restaurant locations.
